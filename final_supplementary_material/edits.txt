NOTE: line changes refer to original file; for added lines, line changes include comments acting as edit labels
All edits were made to fit.py (now modified_fit.py); different_input_sets.py is original code.

Edit 1: make the data file read by read_cs_data() a parameter of the method
A: add parameter to method signature; changed line 18
B: edit is not used by the comment, but allows the code to run as the original code did; added one line above line 170, changed line 170

Edit 2: determine constants from data file
A: replace original initial values with None; changed lines: 13-15
B: determines the values of the constants from the data file, assigns them; inserted 33 lines in between lines 34 and 35

Edit 3: modifications to group_validation(data, order, norms, reg_param)
A: the addition of the PRad data makes the logic invalid; empty arrays are added to val_indices because the new beam energies were never measured with the Mainz spectrometers, and the new spectrometer never measured with the Mainz energies; replaced line 122 with 3 lines (1 of which was the original line 122 indented)
B: commented out print statement so different_input_sets.py output can be clean; added line above line 130, changed line 130
C: added a return statement returing the un-rounded values of chi^2_train and chi^2_test, to be used in different_input_sets.py; inserted 2 lines underneath line 130
D: edit is not used by the comment, but allows the code to run as the original code did; replaced line 180 with 3 lines

Edit 4: changed import statement importing methods from models.py as models.py has a different relative path compared to the original folder; changed line 11
