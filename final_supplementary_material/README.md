# Comment on "Transverse charge density and the radius of the proton"

This repository contains 
Extractions of the charge radius for all data sets can be completed using the ```different_input_data.py``` script.

The ```different_input_data.py``` script runs the extractions by referencing the ```modified_fit.py``` script, which is a modified version of the ```fit.py``` script from Gramolin and Russell's PYTHON code. All modifications are recorded in the text file ```edits.txt```.

Instructions on running ```different_input_data.py```:
> In the main method, 


The folder called 'gramolin_repo' is an exact copy of the repository containing Gramolin and Russell's original PYTHON code, which can be found at: https://github.com/gramolin/radius. The folder is included for reference and for one file/module, plot.py, which is imported and utilized by the modified_fit.py script. 

This repository contains the exact same code:

WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS:
> Code additions: alt_data_methods.py AND run_alt_data.py. Modifications: a number of minor changes to fit.py have been made and commented. See modification.txt for full list.
