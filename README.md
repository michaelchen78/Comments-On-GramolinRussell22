There are two main directories: ```final_supplementary_material``` and ```working_folder```.

Both directories have their own README, which you should refer to for the contents of that directory. In summary....
 > ```final_supplementary_material``` contains the code and files that are intended for the supplementary material (which we discussed) -- so just the things needed for running the different input data sets. 
 > ```working_folder``` contains most of the work I did, it also contains the plot code in ```run_alternative_data.plot_alt_data.py```. Since we said (I think) we probably won't put the plot code into the supplementary material, the code/comments are a lot less formal in this directory.
