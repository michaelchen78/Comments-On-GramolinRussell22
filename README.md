There are two main directories: ```final_supplementary_material``` and ```working_folder```.

# ```final_supplementary_material```
This contains the code and files that are intended for the supplementary material (which we discussed) -- so just the things needed for running the different input data sets. This directory has it's own README, which you should refer to for the contents of that directory.

# ```working_folder```
This directory contains most of the work I did.
